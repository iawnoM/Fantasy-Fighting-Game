# Fantasy Fighting Game
 An object oriented text based looter game in C++

_Overview_:
This text based game uses a multitude of objects to create a fighting game with currency, weapons, and character customization. It is a turn based game which allows the user to use differnt combinations of weapons and armor to defeat enemies and gain currency. The current version of the code only includes partial user input, but there are plans to make it fully user based in the future. 

_Game Flow:_
Most actions can be controlled at any time during the game using specific keybinds. The user can enter each part of the game including the shop, arena, and inventory by using these keybinds. Each item has a unique name as well as price depending on it's stats. Currently there is no end to the game, but players can create new characters and savve progress on current ones as they wish. Game progress is saved using a .dat file and the user is prompted to save each time the program is closed.
